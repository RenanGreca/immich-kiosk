## What is Immich Kiosk?
I made Immich Kiosk as a lightweight slideshow to run on kiosk devices and browsers.

### Example 1
You want to have a slideshow of your Immmich images using the webpage card in Home Assistant.

1. Open up the dahsboard you want to add the slideshow to in edit mode.
2. Hit "add card" and search "webpage".
3. Enter the your Immich Kiosk url in the URL field e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000`
4. If you want to have some specific settings for the slideshow you can add them to the *[URL](#changing-settings-via-url)

\* I would suggest disabling all the UI i.e. `http://192.168.0.123:3000?disable_ui=true`

### Example 2
You have a two spare Raspberry Pi's laying around. One hooked up to a LCD screen and the other you connect to your TV. You install a fullscreen browser OS or service on them (I use [DietPi][dietpi-url]).

You want the pi connected to the LCD screen to only show images from your recent holiday, which are stored in a album on Immich. It's an older pi so you want to disable CSS transitions, also we don't want to display the time of the image.

Using this URL `http://{URL}?album={ALBUM_ID}&transtion=none&show_time=false` would achieve what we want.

On the pi connected to the TV you want to display a random image from your library but only images of two specific people. It has to be fullscreen and we want to use the fade transition

Using this URL `http://{URL}?full_screen=true&transition=fade&person=PERSON_1_ID&person=PERSON_2_ID` would achieve what we want.

## Changing settings via URL
You can configure settings for individual devices through the URL. This feature is particularly useful when you need different settings for different devices, especially if the only input option available is a URL, such as with kiosk devices.

example:

`https://{URL}?refresh=120&background_blur=false&transition=none`

Thos above would set refresh to 120 seconds (2 minutes), turn off the background blurred image and remove all transitions for this device/browser.

------

## Image fit

This controls how the image will fit on your screen.
The options are:

### Contain (the default)
The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit the whole screen. If the image is smaller than your screen, there will be some fuzzyness to your image.

### Cover
The image will cover the whole screen. To achieve this the image will mostly likely have some clipping/cropping and if the image is smaller than your screen, there will be some fuzzyness to your image.

### None
The image is centered and displayed "as is". If the image is larger than your screen it will be scaled down to fit your screen.

## FAQ

![no-wifi icon](/assets/offline.svg)\
**Q: What is the no wifi icon?**\
**A**: This icon shows when the front end can't connect to the back end .

**Q: Can I use this to set Immich images as my Home Assistant dashboard background?**\
**A**: Yes! Just navigate to the dashboard with the view you wish to add the image background to. Enter edit mode and click the ‚úè next to the view you want to add the image to. Then select the "background" tab and toggle on "Local path or web URL" and enter your url with path `/image` and the query `raw` e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image?raw`. If you want to specify an album or a person you can also add that to the url e.g. `http://192.168.0.123:3000/image?album=ALBUM_ID&raw`

**Q: Do I need to a docker service for each client?**\
**A**: Nope. Just one that your client(s) will connect to.

**Q: Do I have to use port 3000?**\
**A**: Nope. Just change the host port in your docker compose file i.e. `- 3000:3000` to `- PORT_YOU_WANT:3000`

**Q: How do I get a album ID?**\
**A**: Open Immich's web interface and click on "Albums" in the left hand navigation.
Click on the album you want the ID of.
The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/albums/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
The album ID is everything after `albums/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.

**Q: How do I get a persons ID?**\
**A**: Open Immich's web interface and click on "Explore" in the left hand navigation.
Click on the person you want the ID of (you may have to click "view all" if you don't see them).
The url will now look something like this `http://192.168.86.123:2283/people/a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.
The persons ID is everything after `people/`, so in this example it would be `a04175f4-97bb-4d97-8d49-3700263043e5`.

**Q: How do I set multiple people?**\
**A**: üëá
* via config.yaml file
```yaml
person:
  - PERSON_ID
  - PERSON_ID
```

* via ENV in your docker-compose file use a `,` to separate IDs
```yaml
environment:
  KIOSK_PERSON: "PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID,PERSON_ID"
```

* via url quires `http://{URL}?person=PERSON_ID&person=PERSON_ID&person=PERSON_ID`
